# Netlify Upload Instructions

This folder contains static pages you can add to your Netlify site `beautiful-marshmallow-8ebfc5.netlify.app`.

Files:
- `evidence-library.html`: New Evidence Library page styled to match your platform.

How to add to your live site:
1. Download the file(s) from this folder to your local machine.
2. In your Netlify project, drag-and-drop the HTML file(s) into the publish directory of your site repo/build output, or:
   - If your site is a static folder deploy, add the file(s) to the root of the published directory and redeploy.
   - If your site is built from a Git repo, create a new commit adding `evidence-library.html` at the site root and push to your default branch.
3. After deploy, the page will be live at `/evidence-library.html`.

Optional navigation link:
- On your homepage, add a card or link pointing to `/evidence-library.html` so users can find it easily.

SEO notes:
- The page includes a `<meta name="description">` tag; feel free to customize.
